# Line follower with water detection

Team project with my colleague [@andreeaonaci](https://github.com/andreeaonaci) consisting of a line-following car with water detection and an umbrella.

Components used include Arduino Uno board, infrared sensors, DC motors, servo motor, H-bridge, water level sensor

The car, using the left and right infrared sensors follows a black line on the ground by adjusting the speed of the 4 DC motors controlled by the H-bridge and moves the umbrella above the circuits using the servo motor when detecting water with the sensor
